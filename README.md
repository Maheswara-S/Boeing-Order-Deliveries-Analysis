# Boeing Order Deliveries Analysis

This is a project of exploring Boeing order and deliveries performance over the year, to explore and find out on what aspect should boing improve their performance. This project is done mainly using Pandas and numpy for data processing, for visualization Seaborn and Matplotlib are used.

Based on my analysis, it can be concluded that:

1. Boeing's average total order is higher than its average total delivery, which means that Boeing still have a lot of unfilled orders.
2. Boeing 737 MAX is the most ordered aircraft of the last 10 years and of all time. Presummably it just recently surpass 737-800 order of all time. This means that 737 MAX is a successful product.
3. The most used engine of the lsat 10 years and of all time is CF (CFM International Leap), and it is likely that this will still be the case for a few years later.
4. United Airlines, American Airlines, Ryan Air, Southwest Airlines, Lion Air are a loyal customer to Boeing. A lot of the unfilled orders is within the last 10 years.
